  <version> can be 1.1.0-rc1 for example
  <variant> is always one of the two values: release, debug

The debug variant will print additional information on the screen at runtime that may help identify the issue you are facing.

After installing, testing, and running the latest debug variant, please try to fill out as much information as possible below.
